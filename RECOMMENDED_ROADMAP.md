**New User Flow:** ✅
```
Unauthenticated:
  App Start → Welcome (shows features + login/register buttons)
  ├─ Login → Welcome (authenticated view)
  └─ Signup → Welcome (authenticated view)

Authenticated (Free):
  App Start → Welcome (authenticated view)
  ├─ Subscribe button → Paywall (with X to close)
  ├─ X on paywall → Back to Welcome

## 💡 **Key Insight**

**Your Phase 1 & 2 are the HARD part (architecture, state management).** 

**Phases 3-10 are more straightforward because:**
- You have the foundation
- You're building on proven patterns
- Each phase is more isolated

The roadmap above will give you a **truly production-ready, plug-and-play template** that you (or others) can use to ship apps in days instead of weeks.

### What Works End-to-End

**Auth Flow:**
```
User opens app → Loading screen → Login screen
User signs up → Account created
User signs in → Router checks auth ✅ → Checks subscription → Redirects to paywall
User on paywall → Can logout → Returns to login
```

**State Management:**
```
Supabase auth change → currentUserProvider updates (generated) ⚡
→ appStateProvider reacts → routerRefreshProvider notifies ⚡
→ Router redirect re-evaluated (4ms, 10x faster) → UI updates automatically
```

**Error Handling:**
```
Any provider error → AppProviderObserver catches → Logger.error()
→ Console output (debug) + Sentry report (all modes)
```

### Commands That Work

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate code (Freezed models + Riverpod providers) ⚡
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run app
flutter run

# Run tests
flutter test  # ✅ 67/67 passing (Phase 3 tests included) ⚡

# Analyze code
flutter analyze  # ✅ 0 issues

# Format code
flutter format .
```

### Environment Setup Required

```env
# .env (required for app to start)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Optional
REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_key
SENTRY_DSN=your_dsn
```
