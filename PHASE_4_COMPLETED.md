## 🚀 How to Use This Template Now

### For Developers Building Their App:

1. **Start at:** `lib/features/app/screens/app_home_screen.dart`
   - This is what paid users see after subscribing
   - Replace example features with your own

2. **Add features:**
   ```dart
   // Create: lib/features/app/screens/my_feature_screen.dart
   // Add route in: lib/core/router/app_router.dart under '/app' group
   // Link from: app_home_screen.dart
   ```

3. **Automatic protection:**
   - All `/app/*` routes require active subscription
   - Router automatically redirects free users to paywall
   - No extra code needed!

4. **Use existing components:**
   - `AppButton`, `AppTextField`, `AppCard`
   - `SubscriptionBadge` for branding
   - `AppDialog`, `AppSnackBar` for feedback
   - Responsive utilities

---

## 🎓 Key Architectural Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Subscription Gating Pattern
```dart
// Router automatically checks subscription for /app/* routes
if (isOnAppRoute && !hasActiveSubscription) {
  return '/paywall';
}
```

### 2. Conditional Home Screen
```dart
// Free users see upgrade CTA
// Paid users see app access
appState.subscription.when(
  data: (subscription) => subscription.isActive 
    ? _PaidUserView() 
    : _FreeUserView(),
)
```

### 3. Deep Link Auth Flows
```dart
// Emails contain links like: apptemplate://auth-callback?type=recovery
// Router extracts parameters and handles appropriately
AuthCallbackScreen(type, accessToken, refreshToken)
```

### 4. Self-Documenting Code
- Extensive comments explaining WHERE to add code
- Clear TODO markers for developers
- Example implementations to copy
- File location guidance
