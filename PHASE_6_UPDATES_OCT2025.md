# Phase 6 Critical Updates - October 2025

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Production Ready  
**Changes:** Android API 35 compliance, version requirements documentation

---

## üö® Critical Updates Applied

### 1. Android targetSdk Updated to API 35 ‚úÖ

**File:** `android/app/build.gradle.kts`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `minSdk` from `flutter.minSdkVersion` (21) to **23** (Android 6.0)
- ‚úÖ Updated `targetSdk` from `flutter.targetSdkVersion` (34) to **35** (Android 15)
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive comments explaining API level requirements
- ‚úÖ Documented Google Play Store deadline (August 31, 2025)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Google Play Requirement:** As of August 31, 2025, all apps must target API 35+
- **App Rejection:** Apps targeting API 34 or lower will be rejected by Play Store
- **Security:** API 23+ includes runtime permissions and modern security features
- **Device Support:** minSdk 23 covers 95%+ of active Android devices

**Before:**
```kotlin
minSdk = flutter.minSdkVersion    // API 21 (Android 5.0)
targetSdk = flutter.targetSdkVersion  // API 34 (Android 14)
```

**After:**
```kotlin
minSdk = 23        // API 23 (Android 6.0) - Better security
targetSdk = 35     // API 35 (Android 15) - Required for Play Store
```
