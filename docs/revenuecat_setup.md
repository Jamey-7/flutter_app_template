Complete guide for setting up RevenueCat subscriptions across all supported platforms.

---

## üß™ Development Testing Mode (Start Here!)

Before setting up RevenueCat, you can **test your paywall UI immediately** using built-in test mode:

### Quick Start

1. In your `.env` file, enable test mode:
   ```env
   SUBSCRIPTION_TEST_MODE=true
   ```

2. Hot restart your app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. Navigate to the paywall screen - you'll see:
   - ‚úÖ Mock subscription products ($2.99/month, $9.99/year)
   - ‚úÖ "TEST MODE" badge in the app bar
   - ‚úÖ Instant paywall loading (no network calls)
   - ‚úÖ Functional "Subscribe" buttons for UI testing

### What Test Mode Does

- **Bypasses RevenueCat entirely** - No API keys needed
- **Shows mock products** - $2.99/month and $9.99/year subscriptions
- **Simulates purchases** - "Buy" buttons work and show success dialogs
- **Perfect for development** - Design your paywall without backend setup

### When to Use Test Mode

‚úÖ **Use test mode when:**
- Designing and testing your paywall UI
- Working on app features without RevenueCat setup
- Creating app templates for reuse
- Developing on multiple machines without sharing keys

‚ùå **Disable test mode for:**
- Production builds (will error if enabled!)
- Testing real payment flows
- Testing subscription renewals/cancellations
- Integration with actual App Store/Play Store

### Disable Test Mode

When ready for production RevenueCat setup:

```env
SUBSCRIPTION_TEST_MODE=false
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Release builds will **throw an error** if test mode is accidentally enabled, preventing you from shipping mock subscriptions to production users.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get API Keys

### Platform-Specific Public SDK Keys

**You need SEPARATE API keys for iOS and Android platforms.**

1. In RevenueCat dashboard, go to **Project Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys**
2. Under **App specific keys**, you'll see separate keys for each app:
   - **iOS/macOS app**: Key starts with `appl_`
   - **Android app**: Key starts with `goog_`
3. Copy both keys and add to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   REVENUECAT_IOS_API_KEY=appl_xxxxxxxxxx
   REVENUECAT_ANDROID_API_KEY=goog_xxxxxxxxxx
   ```

**Important:**
- Use the **public** SDK keys (safe to include in app)
- Never use the secret API key in your app
- iOS and macOS use the **same** `appl_` key
- Each platform needs its own key for proper product/subscription handling

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Entitlements Configuration

### What are Entitlements?

Entitlements represent **what users have access to** in your app, regardless of which product they purchased.

**Example:**
- Products: `monthly_premium`, `yearly_premium`, `lifetime_premium`
- Entitlement: `premium`
- Result: All three products grant the same `premium` access

### Default Entitlement

The template uses `premium` as the default entitlement identifier.

**File:** `.env`
```
REVENUECAT_ENTITLEMENT_ID=premium
```

**Code:** `lib/providers/subscription_provider.dart`
```dart
final entitlement = customerInfo.entitlements.all[entitlementId];
if (entitlement != null && entitlement.isActive) {
  // User has premium access
}
```

### Multiple Entitlements (Advanced)

For apps with multiple tiers:

**Entitlements:**
- `basic` - Basic features
- `premium` - Premium features
- `pro` - Pro features

**Products:**
- `monthly_basic` ‚Üí `basic` entitlement
- `monthly_premium` ‚Üí `premium` entitlement
- `monthly_pro` ‚Üí `pro` entitlement

**Check in app:**
```dart
final basicActive = customerInfo.entitlements.all['basic']?.isActive ?? false;
final premiumActive = customerInfo.entitlements.all['premium']?.isActive ?? false;
final proActive = customerInfo.entitlements.all['pro']?.isActive ?? false;
```

### Package Types

RevenueCat provides standard package identifiers:

```dart
@riverpod
Future<Offerings?> offerings(OfferingsRef ref) async {
  final offerings = await SubscriptionService.getOfferings();
  return offerings;
}
```

**Usage:** `lib/features/subscriptions/screens/paywall_screen.dart`

```dart
final offeringsAsync = ref.watch(offeringsProvider);

offeringsAsync.when(
  data: (offerings) {
    if (offerings == null || offerings.current == null) {
      return EmptyState(message: 'No plans available');
    }
    
    final packages = offerings.current!.availablePackages;
    // Display packages in UI
