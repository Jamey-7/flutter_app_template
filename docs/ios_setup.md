## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Bundle Identifier Configuration

### Update Bundle ID in Xcode

1. Open the iOS project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
   ```

2. Select the **Runner** project in the left sidebar

3. Select the **Runner** target under "TARGETS"

4. Go to the **General** tab

5. Update the **Bundle Identifier**:
   - Default: `com.example.appTemplate`
   - Change to: `com.yourcompany.yourappname`
   - Example: `com.acme.fitnessapp`

6. **Important:** Use lowercase, no spaces, no special characters except dots

### Update Display Name

1. In the same **General** tab, find **Display Name**
2. Change from "App Template" to your app's name
3. This is what users see on their home screen

### Alternative: Update in Info.plist

You can also update the display name in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
<string>Your App Name</string>
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ App Icons & Launch Screen

### App Icons

1. Prepare app icons in required sizes:
   - 1024x1024 (App Store)
   - 180x180 (iPhone)
   - 167x167 (iPad Pro)
   - 152x152 (iPad)
   - 120x120 (iPhone)
   - 87x87 (iPhone)
   - 80x80 (iPad)
   - 76x76 (iPad)
   - 60x60 (iPhone)
   - 58x58 (iPhone/iPad)
   - 40x40 (iPhone/iPad)
   - 29x29 (iPhone/iPad)
   - 20x20 (iPhone/iPad)

2. Add icons to Xcode:
   - In Xcode, open `Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`
   - Drag and drop icons into appropriate slots
   - Or use a tool like [App Icon Generator](https://appicon.co/)

### Launch Screen (Splash Screen)

The template includes a basic launch screen at `ios/Runner/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard`.

**Option 1: Customize in Xcode**
1. Open `LaunchScreen.storyboard` in Xcode
2. Modify the UI elements (logo, background color, etc.)
3. Keep it simple - iOS guidelines recommend minimal splash screens

**Option 2: Use flutter_native_splash package**
1. Add to `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     flutter_native_splash: ^2.3.0
   ```

2. Configure in `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   flutter_native_splash:
     color: "#ffffff"
     image: assets/splash_logo.png
     ios: true
   ```

3. Generate splash screens:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
   ```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Permissions & Privacy

### Current Permissions

The template **does not require any special permissions** by default. It only uses:
- Network access (automatic)
- Deep linking (already configured)

### Adding App-Specific Permissions

If your app needs additional permissions (camera, photos, location, etc.), add them to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

**Camera Access:**
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need camera access to take photos</string>
```

**Photo Library:**
```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need photo library access to select images</string>
```

**Location (When In Use):**
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places</string>
```

**Location (Always):**
```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to track your activity</string>
```

**Microphone:**
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need microphone access to record audio</string>
```

**Contacts:**
```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your contacts</string>
```

**Calendar:**
```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your calendar</string>
```

**Reminders:**
```xml
<key>NSRemindersUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your reminders</string>
```

**Bluetooth:**
```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need Bluetooth access to connect to devices</string>
```

**Face ID:**
```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use Face ID for secure authentication</string>
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Linking (Already Configured ‚úÖ)

Deep linking was configured in Phase 4. Verify it's set up correctly:

### Check Info.plist

Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and verify:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>com.apptemplate.auth</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>apptemplate</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

### Customize URL Scheme

Change `apptemplate` to your app's unique scheme:
- Use lowercase
- No spaces or special characters
- Example: `myfitnessapp`, `acmestore`, etc.

### Update .env File

Update `SUPABASE_REDIRECT_URL` in `.env`:
```
SUPABASE_REDIRECT_URL=yourappscheme://auth-callback
```

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Build Configuration

### Update Version & Build Number

Edit `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
version: 1.0.0+1
```
- `1.0.0` = Version number (user-facing)
- `+1` = Build number (increments with each upload)

### Build Modes

**Debug Build (Development):**

## üîü Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No valid code signing certificates found"

**Solution:**
1. Open Xcode ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Accounts
2. Add your Apple ID

1. Revoke old certificates in Apple Developer Portal
2. Create new certificate
3. Download and install in Keychain
4. Regenerate provisioning profile

### Issue: RevenueCat not working in simulator

**Solution:**
- RevenueCat requires StoreKit configuration file for simulator testing
- Or test on physical device with sandbox account
- See [RevenueCat Setup Guide](./revenuecat_setup.md)

### Issue: Deep links not working
